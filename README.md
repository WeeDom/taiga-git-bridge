## Run with Docker Compose (Nginx & PHP-FPM)

This setup uses two containers:
- **php**: Runs PHP-FPM and SlimPHP
- **nginx**: Serves requests and proxies PHP files to the php container

Build and start the app in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

All requests are routed to `index.php` as needed for SlimPHP routing.
## Run with Docker

Build and run the container:

```bash
docker build -t taiga-git-bridge .
docker run -p 8080:8080 taiga-git-bridge
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
# SlimPHP Day 1 Setup

This project uses [SlimPHP](https://www.slimframework.com/) as the framework.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

	If not already done, run:
	```bash
	composer install
	```
	Always ensure you run `composer install` after adding or updating dependencies. The Docker build process also runs this step to keep dependencies up to date.

2. **Run the application**

	You can use PHP's built-in server:
	```bash
	php -S localhost:8080 index.php
	```

3. **Access the app**

	Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Project Structure

- `index.php` ‚Äî Main entry point with a basic Slim route
- `composer.json` ‚Äî Composer dependencies

## Next Steps
- Add more routes and features as needed!
# taiga-git-bridge
Connecting git and taiga

## Purpose

Enable git and taiga to keep each other up to date.

## Create a story/task/issue in taiga, have it created as PR/Issue in github

Goal Build an open-source bridge that syncs Taiga tasks ‚Üî GitHub Issues (titles, descriptions, status, comments, labels).

Scope

MVP (Taiga ‚Üí GitHub, one-way):

Create/update GitHub Issues from Taiga tasks.

Sync title, description, status (open/closed), labels.

Store Taiga IDs in GitHub (body or taiga:#123 label).

Dockerized deployment.


Extended (two-way):

GitHub ‚Üí Taiga updates.

Comment sync both ways; basic assignee mapping.

Conflict policy (last-write-wins or system-of-record).

Drift reconciliation job.



Tech Python (FastAPI/Flask) or Node (Express). Taiga REST + webhooks; GitHub Issues API + webhooks. SQLite/Postgres for ID mapping + logs. Dockerized. Auth via Taiga token + GitHub PAT/App.

Timeline (5 days, ~2‚Äì3 hrs/day)

Day 1: Repo scaffold, Dockerfile, .env, API connectivity tests.

Day 2: Taiga webhook ‚Üí GitHub issue creation/update + mapping/logging.

Day 3: GitHub webhook ‚Üí Taiga updates + loop prevention.

Day 4: Comment sync + assignee mapping.

Day 5: README, sequence diagram, screenshots, local deploy, short write-up.


Deliverables Public repo, Docker setup, detailed README, screenshots, and a brief blog/case study. Stretch goals: CLI reconciliation, GitHub Action, mocked-API tests, CI.


## further clarification of steps needed.


üîß Step 1. Decide on mapping (source of truth)

Epic ‚Üî GitHub Milestone

Story ‚Üî GitHub Issue

Task ‚Üî GitHub Issue (labelled task)

Taiga bug ‚Üî GitHub Issue (labelled bug)

Status ‚Üî GitHub Project column

üëâ Add Taiga ID into GitHub Issue title or label (e.g. [TG-123] Story title). That becomes your ‚Äúforeign key‚Äù for syncing.

üîß Step 2. Set up Taiga webhooks

In your Taiga project, go to Admin ‚Üí Webhooks.

Create a webhook pointing to your bridge service (e.g. https://your-bridge/taiga/webhook).

Configure it to fire on: userstory, task, issue, and epic.

üîß Step 3. Set up GitHub webhooks

In your GitHub repo, go to Settings ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Add Webhook.

URL: https://your-bridge/github/webhook.

Choose events: issues, milestone, pull_request.

üîß Step 4. Write the bridge service

Basic flow (Python/Flask example):

from flask import Flask, request
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

# Taiga ‚Üí GitHub
@app.route("/taiga/webhook", methods=["POST"])
def taiga_webhook():
    data = request.json
    if data["type"] == "userstory":
        story_id = data["data"]["id"]
        title = f"[TG-{story_id}] {data['data']['subject']}"
        desc = data["data"]["description"]
        state = data["data"]["status"]

        sync_story_to_github(story_id, title, desc, state)
    return "ok"

# GitHub ‚Üí Taiga
@app.route("/github/webhook", methods=["POST"])
def github_webhook():
    data = request.json
    if "issue" in data:
        issue = data["issue"]
        taiga_id = extract_taiga_id(issue["title"])
        if data["action"] == "closed":
            mark_story_done_in_taiga(taiga_id)
    return "ok"

üîß Step 5. Implement API helpers

GitHub REST API v3

Create/Update Issue: POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues

Close Issue: PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}

Taiga API

Stories: PATCH /userstories/{id} (to update status)

Tasks: PATCH /tasks/{id}

Epics: PATCH /epics/{id}

üîß Step 6. Handle conflicts

Decide rules:

If Story closed in GitHub ‚Üí always mark closed in Taiga.

If status changed in Taiga ‚Üí update Project column in GitHub.

Epics/milestones: keep titles/descriptions in sync.

üîß Step 7. Deploy + secure

Deploy the bridge (Heroku, Render, Fly.io, or your own VPS).

Add secret tokens to webhooks (both sides support a signing secret).

Store Taiga + GitHub API tokens as environment variables.

üîß Step 8. Test

Create a Story in Taiga ‚Üí should auto-create a GitHub Issue with the right milestone.

Close Issue via PR ‚Üí Taiga Story moves to ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù

Update Epic in Taiga ‚Üí milestone in GitHub updates.

## Note on Taiga Webhook URLs

Taiga does not accept webhook URLs that use `localhost` or private IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.*`).

To test webhooks locally, you must expose your bridge service to the public internet using a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/).

More simply - add something lie `127.0.0.1   slimphp.local` to the host (dev machine) /etc/hosts.


Set your webhook URL in Taiga to the public address provided by these tunneling services.
# Debugging with Xdebug and VS Code in Docker

## Step-by-step setup and troubleshooting

### 1. Install and configure Xdebug in Docker
- Use the official PHP Docker image (e.g., `php:8.2-apache`).
- Install Xdebug via PECL in your Dockerfile:
  ```Dockerfile
  RUN pecl install xdebug \
      && docker-php-ext-enable xdebug
  COPY xdebug.ini /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/xdebug.ini
  ```
- Example `xdebug.ini`:
  ```ini
  zend_extension=xdebug
  xdebug.mode=debug
  xdebug.start_with_request=yes
  xdebug.client_host=<your_host_ip>
  xdebug.client_port=9003
  xdebug.log=/tmp/xdebug.log
  xdebug.log_level=10
  ```
  Replace `<your_host_ip>` with your actual host IP (see below).

### 2. VS Code launch.json configuration
- Add to `.vscode/launch.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
    "type": "php",
    "request": "launch",
    "port": 9003,
    "pathMappings": {
      "/var/www/html": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Remove port mapping for 9003 in Docker Compose
- Do **not** expose port 9003 in your `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  # Remove or comment out:
  # ports:
  #   - "9003:9003"
  ```
  Xdebug connects out to VS Code; you do not need to expose this port.

### 4. Find your host IP address
- Run:
  ```bash
  hostname -I
  ```
- Use the first IP address in your `xdebug.ini` as `xdebug.client_host`.

### 5. Start VS Code debugger
- Open the Run and Debug panel in VS Code.
- Select "Listen for Xdebug" and click the green start button.
- The blue bar at the bottom of VS Code means it is listening.

### 6. Verify port usage with netstat
- To check which process is listening on port 9003:
  ```bash
  sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 9003
  ```
  - `-t` = TCP
  - `-u` = UDP
  - `-l` = Listening sockets
  - `-n` = Show numeric addresses/ports
  - `-p` = Show process ID/program name
- You should see VS Code (`code`) listening, not Docker.
- If Docker is listening, remove the port mapping and restart.

### 7. Troubleshooting Xdebug connection
- If breakpoints are not hit:
  - Check `/tmp/xdebug.log` inside the container for connection attempts/errors:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container_name> cat /tmp/xdebug.log
    ```
  - Common error: `getaddrinfo: No such file or directory` for `host.docker.internal` on Linux. Use your host IP instead.
  - Make sure VS Code is running and listening before triggering PHP code.

### 8. Test with a minimal script
- Create `public/test.php`:
  ```php
  <?php
  xdebug_break();
  echo "Test";
  ```
- Set a breakpoint and access `http://localhost:8081/test.php`.

### 9. Summary of key lessons
- On Linux, use your host IP for `xdebug.client_host`.
- Do not expose port 9003 in Docker Compose.
- Use netstat to check port usage and resolve conflicts.
- Always check Xdebug logs for connection issues.
